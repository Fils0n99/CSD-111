<!-- Design and implement a program that asks the user to enter arbitrary number of positive and negative integers.
Each time the user enters an integer the program asks whether the user wants to enter one more. Store the integers in the array.
Use a loop to output all the integers stored in array in two groups: first output all negative integers and their sum, then output all positive integers and their sum.
Do not output 0 even if it is present in the array.
See sample output below:
You entered the following negative integers: -4, -7, -1
The sum of all negative integers is: -12
You entered the following positive integers: 1, 10, 3, 5
The sum of all positive integers is: 19 -->
